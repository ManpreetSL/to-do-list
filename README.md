# Avtar's to do list app
âœ¨ A simple task tracker built with React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + Local storage.

## Features (What can the app do?)
- Add, edit and delete tasks
- Add a due date
- Change task status (not started, in progress or complete)
- Search the list of created tasks
- Sort items by various properties

## Why did I make this app?
* I've been working as a software engineer for years but I keep thinking I'm not where I "should" be.
* This app is the first of many to build a personal track record for myself outside of work.
* I started with something so simple because due to AuDHD and perfectionism, I often trip myself up by making lofty plans and not executing them all the way through to the arbitrary finish lines I set for myself.
  * So the idea here is to start simple, and build more and more complex things with each project idea.
  * Progress > perfectionism
* I want to practice doing more UX/UI-type thinking instead of just implementing designs that are already given to me.
